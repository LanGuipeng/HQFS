HQFS: High Quality Face Swapping with Multi-scale Adaptive Identity Mapping and Dual Latent En-decoding
---
*This is the official code of HQFS, which is implemented by PyTorch.*

><font color="#000066">Abstract</font><br /> 

>>we propose a high-quality face swapping framework (HQFS). Analysis of the latent space of HQFS revealed varying degrees of identity information in feature blocks at different levels. Building on this discovery, a multi-scale adaptive identity mapping module is proposed to locate the identity information of different feature levels for achieving identity information transformation while keeping other attributes unchanged. Furthermore, to further disentangle identity information from other information in latent codes, a new dual en-decoding generation strategy is proposed. This strategy enhances the authenticity of facial regions, particularly the hue of facial images.
